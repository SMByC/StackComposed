The StackComposed compute the stack composed of a specific statistic of band values for several time series of georeferenced data (such as Landsat images), even if these are in different scenes or tiles. The result is a output of statistic compute for all valid pixels values across the time axis (z-axis), in the wrapper extent for all input data in parallels process.
